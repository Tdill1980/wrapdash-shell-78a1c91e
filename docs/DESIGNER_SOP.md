## Standard Operating Procedure — Vehicle Wrap Design Team

## Why ApproveFlow Exists

ApproveFlow is your **single source of truth** for every design project. It:

- Eliminates email chaos and version confusion
- Increases approval rates through 3D visualization
- Creates an auditable timeline of every decision
- Hands off cleanly to MyShopFlow for customer approval

**Your job is to produce. The customer's job is to approve.**  
ApproveFlow enforces this separation.

## The Locked Workflow (Non-Negotiable)

Every project follows this exact sequence:

```
1. Order Received     → System captures WooCommerce data
2. Upload 2D Proof    → YOU upload your design file
3. Generate 3D Render → System creates realistic visualization  
4. Enter Specs        → YOU fill production specifications
5. Generate Proof     → System builds approval package
6. Send to Customer   → Customer sees MyShopFlow approval page
```

**The progress bar tracks YOUR production milestones, not the customer's approval status.**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Review Order (Zone 2 — Source of Truth)

When you open a project:

1. Read the **customer instructions** carefully
2. Review any **uploaded reference files**
3. Note the **vehicle info** (year/make/model)
4. Check **color requirements**

> ⚠️ This section is **READ ONLY**. You cannot edit WooCommerce data.

---

### Step 2: Upload 2D Proof (Zone 4 — First Action)

1. Create your 2D design in Illustrator/Photoshop
2. Click **"Upload 2D Proof"**
3. Add version notes describing what you created
4. Submit

> ✅ The stepper moves to "2D Uploaded" when successful.

---

### Step 3: Generate 3D Render

1. Click **"Generate 3D Render"**
2. Wait for the render to complete
3. Review the 3D visualization

> ✅ The stepper moves to "3D Generated" when successful.

---

### Step 4: Enter Production Specifications

Fill in these fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Total SQ FT | Yes | Total material needed |
| Wrap Scope | Yes | Full wrap, partial, etc. |
| Vehicle Year | Yes | From order or customer |
| Vehicle Make | Yes | From order or customer |
| Vehicle Model | Yes | From order or customer |

> These specs appear on the customer's approval page.

---

### Step 5: Generate Approval Proof

1. Verify all specs are complete
2. Check validation status shows all requirements met
3. Click **"Generate Approval Proof"**

> ✅ The stepper moves to "Proof Built" when successful.

---

### Step 6: Send to Customer

1. Click **"Email Proof to Customer"**
2. Customer receives link to MyShopFlow
3. Customer can approve or request revisions

> ✅ The stepper moves to "Sent to Customer" when the email is sent.

---

## Handling Revisions

When a customer requests changes:

1. Their message appears in the **Timeline** (Zone 3)
2. Read their feedback carefully
3. Create a new 2D design addressing their notes
4. Upload as a new version (do NOT overwrite)
5. Regenerate 3D if the design changed significantly
6. Regenerate the approval proof
7. Resend to customer

> 📝 Every revision is recorded. Nothing is deleted.

## What You Must NOT Do

| ❌ DON'T | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Email proofs manually | Breaks audit trail, bypasses MyShopFlow |
| Skip 2D upload | 3D render needs source file |
| Generate proof without specs | Customer sees incomplete information |
| Edit customer instructions | Source of Truth is read-only |
| Delete old versions | Timeline must be auditable |
| Skip 3D generation | Reduces approval rates significantly |
