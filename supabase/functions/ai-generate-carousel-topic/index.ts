═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CAROUSEL STRUCTURE RULES:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. SLIDE 1 (HOOK): 
   - Stop the scroll in 2 seconds
   - Provocative statement, question, or statistic
   - Create curiosity gap - make them NEED to swipe

2. SLIDES 2-${slideCount - 1} (VALUE):
   - Each slide delivers ONE clear point
   - Build momentum - each slide earns the next
   - Use specific examples, numbers, proof
   - Headlines are punchy (max 8 words)

3. SLIDE ${slideCount} (CTA):
   - Clear call to action
   - Low friction next step
   - Create urgency without desperation

CRITICAL RULES:
- NO generic marketing fluff
- NO emojis in headlines (captions only)
- Every word must EARN its place
- Specificity > generality
- Headlines must work standalone

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):

  "title": "The carousel topic title for internal reference",
