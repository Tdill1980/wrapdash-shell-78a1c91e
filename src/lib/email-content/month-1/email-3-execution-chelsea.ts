  openingCopy: `The customer called on a Tuesday. Fleet vehicle needed wrapped before a trade show on Friday. Only problem?

<strong>It was January in Ohio.</strong>

No heated shop available. Customer couldn't transport. The job had to happen where the truck sat — in a parking garage that wasn't much warmer than outside.

Chelsea Gunnels took the job anyway. Here's what she learned.`,
  
  section1Title: 'The Cold Truth About Vinyl',
  section1Copy: `Below 50°F, most vinyl films become stiff. Adhesive takes longer to activate. Conformability drops. 
<br><br>
Chelsea's approach:
<br><br>
• <strong>Heat guns running constantly</strong> — not just for application, but to keep panels warm before positioning<br>
• <strong>Smaller sections</strong> — work faster before the material cools<br>
• <strong>Propane heater</strong> — aimed at the vehicle surface, not the installer<br>
• <strong>Post-heat everything twice</strong> — cold adhesive needs extra activation
<br><br>
"The material doesn't care about your deadline. You adapt or you fail."`,
  
  section2Title: 'Materials That Held Up',
  section2Copy: `For this job, Chelsea used <strong>3M IJ180Cv3</strong> with <strong>8518</strong> laminate.
<br><br>
Why? The adhesive system performs better in temperature extremes than some competitors. The conformability stays workable longer after heating.
<br><br>
<strong>Total time:</strong> 14 hours across two days<br>
<strong>Result:</strong> Clean wrap, happy customer, truck at the trade show on time
<br><br>
The lesson? Know your materials. Know their limits. And know when to push through versus when to walk away.`,
